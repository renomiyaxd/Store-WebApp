# Store-WebApp
Done in 2017. Web Programming using HTML, CSS, PHP

This store webapp was done back in my Foundation in Computing course days, learning about database, html, and css.
The store webapp works like a typical ebay, Tesco online website, but without the pay feature.

While the contents maybe hilarious/ cringe/ nostalgic for some and may not have much value in today's more elaborate tools as the likes.

You will need to run xaamp, create a database in phpMyAdmin, and get to the localhost in order for this to work.
